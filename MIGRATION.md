# Migration Guide - Enhanced Book Finder

## Overview
This guide will help you migrate from the basic Book Finder to the enhanced version with all new features.

---

## 🔄 Migration Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration (Automatic)
**Good News!** All database schema changes are backward compatible. Existing documents will continue to work, and new fields will be automatically added when users interact with new features.

#### What happens to existing data?
- **Existing Users**: Will have empty `favoriteGenres` and default `preferences`
- **Existing Books**: Will have empty arrays for `genres`, `awards`, `relatedBooks`
- **Reading Progress**: Defaults to 'not-started' status
- No data loss occurs!

### Step 2: No Breaking Changes!
All existing API endpoints continue to work exactly as before. New endpoints are added without modifying existing ones.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Development

1. **Pull the latest code** (or copy the enhanced files)

2. **No new npm packages required!** All features use existing dependencies

3. **Start servers**:
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Server
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Client  
cd client
npm run dev
```

4. **That's it!** All new features are automatically available

## 📊 Data Migration (Optional)

### If you want to populate genres for existing books:

```javascript
// Run this in MongoDB or create a migration script
db.books.updateMany(
  { genres: { $exists: false } },
  { $set: { genres: [] } }
);
```

### To initialize user preferences:

```javascript
db.users.updateMany(
  { preferences: { $exists: false } },
  { 
    $set: { 
      favoriteGenres: [],
      preferences: {
        darkMode: false,
        fontSize: 'medium',
        reducedMotion: false,
        highContrast: false
      }
    } 
  }
);
```

**Note**: These migrations are optional - the app handles missing fields gracefully.

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### No configuration changes required!
All settings use the existing `.env` files.

### Optional: Update Open Library API usage
The search now uses more fields from Open Library. Ensure your API calls aren't rate-limited:
- Free tier: ~100 requests/IP/5min
- The app caches search results automatically

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### 1. MongoDB Indexes
The app automatically creates these indexes:
- `Review`: `{ user: 1, book: 1 }` (unique)
- `Review`: `{ openLibraryId: 1 }`
- `SearchHistory`: `{ user: 1, searchedAt: -1 }`
- `Book`: `{ user: 1, openLibraryId: 1 }` (existing, unchanged)

### 2. Search History Limits
- Automatically limits to last 100 searches per user
- Old searches are automatically deleted

### 3. Theme Persistence
- Dark mode preference stored in localStorage for guests
- Synced with user account when logged in
- Persists across sessions

---

## 🎯 Feature Flags (Optional)

If you want to gradually roll out features, you can add feature flags:

```javascript
// In config or env
const FEATURES = {
  REVIEWS: process.env.ENABLE_REVIEWS !== 'false',
  RECOMMENDATIONS: process.env.ENABLE_RECOMMENDATIONS !== 'false',
  DARK_MODE: process.env.ENABLE_DARK_MODE !== 'false',
  SOCIAL_SHARE: process.env.ENABLE_SOCIAL_SHARE !== 'false'
};
```

---

## 📈 Performance Considerations

### Recommendations
- Limited to 12 books per request
- Uses cached search results when available
- Genres are indexed for faster queries

### Search History
- Auto-cleanup keeps table size manageable
- Indexed for fast queries
- Minimal storage impact

### Reviews
- Paginated by default (though not implemented in UI yet)
- Indexed for fast lookup by book

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

### All new features maintain security:
- ✅ JWT authentication required
- ✅ Users can only modify their own data
- ✅ No sensitive data exposure
- ✅ Input validation on all endpoints
- ✅ XSS protection maintained

---

## 📱 Mobile Responsiveness

All new features are mobile-responsive:
- Filter panel becomes bottom sheet on mobile
- Social share uses native API when available
- Touch-friendly buttons and controls
- Responsive grid layouts

---

## 🐛 Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback:

1. **Database**: No changes needed - old app will ignore new fields
2. **Backend**: Revert to previous server code
3. **Frontend**: Revert to previous client code
4. **Data remains intact** - no data loss

---

## ✅ Post-Migration Checklist

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot read property 'preferences' of undefined"
**Solution**: User object not fully loaded. Check AuthContext initialization.

### Issue: Theme not persisting
**Solution**: Check localStorage access. Ensure ThemeProvider wraps the app.

### Issue: Recommendations not showing
**Solution**: User needs at least one saved book or search. Check SearchHistory creation.

### Issue: Reviews not saving
**Solution**: Ensure book is saved to reading list first (book _id required).

### Issue: Dark mode not applying
**Solution**: Check CSS variables are defined. Ensure ThemeContext is properly initialized.
